            Musk had long been interested in the possibilities of electric cars, and in 2004 he
            became one of the major funders of Tesla Motors (later renamed Tesla), an electric car
            company founded by entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. In 2006 Tesla
            introduced its first car, the Roadster, which could travel 245 miles (394 km) on a
            single charge. Unlike most previous electric vehicles, which Musk thought were stodgy
            and uninteresting, it was a sports car that could go from 0 to 60 miles (97 km) per hour
            in less than four seconds. In 2010 the company’s initial public offering raised about
            $226 million. Two years later Tesla introduced the Model S sedan, which was acclaimed by
            automotive critics for its performance and design. The company won further praise for
            its Model X luxury SUV, which went on the market in 2015. The Model 3, a less-expensive
            vehicle, went into production in 2017 and became the best-selling electric car of all
            time. Dissatisfied with the projected cost ($68 billion) of a high-speed rail system in
            California, Musk in 2013 proposed an alternate faster system, the Hyperloop, a pneumatic
            tube in which a pod carrying 28 passengers would travel the 350 miles (560 km) between
            Los Angeles and San Francisco in 35 minutes at a top speed of 760 miles (1,220 km) per
            hour, nearly the speed of sound. Musk claimed that the Hyperloop would cost only $6
            billion and that, with the pods departing every two minutes on average, the system could
            accommodate the six million people who travel that route every year. However, he stated,
            between running SpaceX and Tesla, he could not devote time to the Hyperloop’s
            development.
